cel_util

Utilities for verifying Canonical Event Log (CEL) formatted measurement lists.
These tools are intended for Linux systems running the new sdboot with UKI
support. The tools can verify the new sdboot stub and systemd events for
these systems. The tools include:

    pcclient_to_cel: translates pcclient measurement lists to CEL
    systemd_to_cel: translates the new systemd journal events to CEL
    ima-ng_to_cel: translates IMA binary events to CEL
    cel_verify: verifies a CEL event log
    verify: a front end script to demonstrate common usage of the utilities
    
Compiling:
    Install dependencies, including openssl-devel, systemd-devel tpm2-tss-devel,
    and the "C Development Tools and Libraries" group
                                    
    make
    
Usage:  cel_verify [-v] [-p pcrs.bin] [-h RIM.txt]
    The script "verify" shows a typical usage sequence.
    The script gets measurement logs from the normal locations, translates
    them to CEL, and verifies them with cel_verify. Verify demonstrates
    creation of a pcrbin file using tpm2_pcrread. An example RIM.txt file
    is included. You can obtain the necessary hashes and descriptions from
    a verbose cel_verify output.
